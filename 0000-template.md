# Abstract
[abstract]: #abstract

A one paragraph explanation of the feature. This may even be a single sentence.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Describe why your proposal is relevant, which use cases it supports, and what we expect the outcome to be.

# Proposed Implementation
[proposed-implementation]: #proposed-implementation

This is the core of your proposal, and its purpose is to help you think through the problem because writing is thinking.

- Clearly name and introduction new concepts.
- Use diagrams to help illustrate your ideas where applicable.
- Include LF code examples and use-cases if you propose changes to the language.
- Also consider to use code snippets and examples if you are proposing an interface or
  system contract.
- Describe the interaction with other components and features.
- Consider to include a guide-level explanation that outlines how you would
  explain this feature to a user (in case of user-facing changes), or to another
  contributor in case of internal changes. Ideally, this serves as a draft for
  later documentation of the feature.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Describe possible reasons for not following up with your proposal and identity
the associated costs. This section will likely get expanded on during the review
process.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Which alternative designs where considered?
- Is there prior art and what can we learn from it?
- Why is the proposed design the best design?

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

Gather open questions that should be answered before the RFC gets accepted and
either list them in the document using markdown quoting or add them to this
section. If you want to mark open questions inline use the following format,
which is easy to spot when reading through the document:

```
> **Open Question**: this is an open question.
```

You may also list further unresolved questions that are beyond the scope of the
RFC process. This may include implementation specific questions that can be
resolved as part of the implementation process or questions that can be
addressed by future RFCs independent of the outcome of this RFC.

This section may be left blank if there are no obvious unresolved questions at
time of submission.

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is a place to collect further ideas that are beyond the scope of the RFC
topic. This is an optional section and may be left blank. It can be used to
collect ideas that pop up during the review process.
